					`ACE is an open-source library of accessible UI components for assistive technology users. Components follow <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/' target="_blank">W3â€™s WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices</a> and feature minimal, easily overridden styling, ensuring compatibility with any design system. The main goal of ACE is to enable developers to build beautiful, fully inclusive websites.`,
					`I led a team of developers and designers to create and build the library then drove it's adoption across high-impact Google and Potato products. Components were built using TypeScript, utilised a bespoke custom events API for programmatic control and event handling, and were tested extensively using Cypress.`,
					`I also implemented a dynamic documentation system using Node.js and CI/CD that renders components alongside their latest code and provides one-click copy, enabling side-by-side preview and seamless developer integration.`
